**💳 Online Payment Fraud Detection**
  This project focuses on detecting fraudulent online payment transactions using machine learning. The dataset is analyzed to identify patterns that distinguish legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones.

**📌 Project Description**
    Load and explore an online payment transaction dataset.
    
    Analyze data distribution and transaction types.
    
    Preprocess and clean the dataset.
    
    Build and evaluate classification models to detect fraud.

**🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used**
    Python
    
    Pandas – data handling
    
    NumPy – numerical operations
    
    Scikit-learn – machine learning models and metrics
    
    Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

**📂 Dataset**
    The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

**⚙️ Steps Performed**
    Loaded the dataset.
    
    Checked for missing values and data types.
    
    Analyzed transaction types and distribution.
    
    Preprocessed features for modeling.
    
    Applied machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
    
    Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

**✅ Results**
    The classification model was able to successfully distinguish fraudulent transactions from normal ones.
    
    The best-performing model showed high precision and recall, minimizing false positives and negatives.

**📈 Sample Outputs**
    Distribution of transaction types
    
    Class imbalance visualization
    
    Model evaluation metrics and confusion matrix
